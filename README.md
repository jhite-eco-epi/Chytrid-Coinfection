Analyses proceed in numerical order following the code. 

01_PairwiseComparisonPart1 - This code runs the pairwise comparisons primarily for single infection treatments

02_PairwiseComparisonPart2 - This code runs the pairwise comparisons primarily for co-infection treatments

03_MortalityStats - Overall mean mortality stats (see additional tables for the hazard ratio data)

04_Plots - Additional plotting
